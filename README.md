# Project Artemis by Team Polaris
##### *Skip the hassle, Meet your Doctor Online*

## Description:

As medical infrastructure struggles to catch up to the growing population and proper medical assistance still being out of reach for many, we aim to bring a technological overhaul to all these problems by introducing our solution to the world, polaris. Our website aims to provide a convenient and secure one-stop platform for patients to consult with doctors online and for doctors to manage all their patients. With just a few clicks, patients can access a network of licensed and experienced doctors who can diagnose and treat their medical conditions remotely. This platform will reduce the need for physical visits to the hospital and enable patients to receive medical care from the comforts and security of their homes. Our website also has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare services. By enabling doctors to consult with patients remotely, our platform can reduce the burden on hospitals and clinics, freeing up resources for more critical cases. It can also enable doctors to provide more personalized and focused care to patients, as they can dedicate their time and attention to individual cases without the distractions of a busy hospital environment. A direct link to professionals can make for healthier communication and better treatment with long-term diagnosis and help. Follow-ups and notifications can be shared between patients and doctors a lot more easily. Doctors can reach out to more  hence increasing their market. All this comes in a feature pack but easy to use website so anyone from a child to a senior citizen can take full advantage of top medical assistance.

## Tech Stack

We used MERN stack (mongoDB, express JS, react JS, node JS) to make our webpage. Using JavaScript throughout the entire application stack means that we can simplify development, reduce code duplication and make it easier to maintain the application. React allows us to create complex user interfaces with reusable components, which can be updated dynamically. This can improve the user experience and make the application more responsive. Node JS is fast and efficient. By using it to write server-side code in Javascript, we can simplify development and make it easier to share code between the client and server. mongoDB can handle large volumes of unstructured data. we can use it to store and retrieve data in a flexible and scalable way. MERN stack also highly scalable, which goes hand in hand for our goal.

## Instructions
- clone this repository into your local host and open using any text editor
- open terminal and type this command to download appropriate libraries: "npm install --legacy-peer-deps"
- type "cd frontend" to reach the frontend folder.
- type "npm install --legacy-peer-deps".

4.  Viewer can register their account using patient registration page, and use those credentials to login using the login page. upon using the correct credentials, user will be redirected to the patient landing page.

### Note: Testers need to have the latest versions of React JS, Node JS, MongoDB, Express JS to successfully run this project.
